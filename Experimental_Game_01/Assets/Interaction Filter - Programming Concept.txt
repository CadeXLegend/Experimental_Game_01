Interaction Filter:

- Contains interaction states/flags
- Subscribes interactions
- Filters input(s) through interactions



Example:

Pre-requisits like components, scripts, etc for Interactions are assigned through the Subscription
Then, whenever Subscriber-related input is received, it is then processed through the Filter
Which sends the input to the interactions for functionalities to be fulfilled

Input -> Get Tile N
		-> Filter(N): run N through Filter
			-> For all Interactions, send N
				-> Interaction event occurs for N
					-> Feedback response occurs
