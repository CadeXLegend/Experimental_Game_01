Creating a game to experiment with new code techniques, and all that.

This is a C# Project.

## Prerequisites

To use this project on your local machine, make sure you have Unity 2019.3.0b12 installed.

```
You can get Unity from here: https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download

I recommend using Unity Hub to manage the versions and projects.
```

## Built With

* [Unity](https://unity3d.com) - The engine used to make the game.
* [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com) - The IDE used to manage the coding side of things.

## License

## Some Noteworthy Things To Remember

### [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID):
* [Single Responsibility Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle)
    
    A class should only have a single responsibility, that is, only changes to one part of the software's specification should be able
    to affect the specification of the class.
* [Open Closed Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open%E2%80%93closed_principle)
    
    Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
* [Liskov Substitution Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle)
    
    Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program.
* [Interface Segregation Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_segregation_principle)
    
    Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.
* [Dependency Inversion Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_inversion_principle)
    
    One should depend upon abstractions, not concretions.

### [The Zen of Python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/):
Beautiful is better than ugly.

Explicit is better than implicit.

Simple is better than complex.

Complex is better than complicated.

Flat is better than nested.

Sparse is better than dense.

Readability counts.

Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.

Although practicality beats purity.

Errors should never pass silently.

Unless explicitly silenced.

In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.

There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.

Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.

Now is better than never.

Although never is often better than *right* now.

If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.

If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.

Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
